General information about interfacing to our family of devices

The interface guide and Excel decoding spread sheet is available here.

Note: The spreadsheet does include a VBA macro written by us.  
The macro is necessary to scan for devices.  The calculations are applicable 
if you elect to disable the macro by manually entering the sensitivity
information.
